Welcome! Here's where I write thoughts on various open source Large Language
Model projects and random things I'm doing.  I'm a former Staff Software
Engineer from Google Translate and until I make it back the states, I'm
spending some time exploring the world of smaller teams and companies.  I
sometimes take on contractor work related to LLMs.  During winter, I spend a
lot of time skiing in Hakuba Japan (if you find yourself there, say hello and I
can show you around).
